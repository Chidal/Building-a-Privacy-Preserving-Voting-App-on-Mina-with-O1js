## 1. Introduction

### The Need for Privacy in Voting
Voting is a fundamental right, but traditional voting systems face major challenges:
- **Lack of Privacy**: Many digital voting systems require personal data, exposing voters to risks.
- **Tampering Risks**: Centralized databases can be manipulated.
- **Lack of Verifiability**: Voters can't check if their vote was counted correctly.

A decentralized, privacy-preserving voting system ensures anonymity, security, and transparency.

### What is Mina Protocol?
Mina is the world's lightest blockchain, using zk-SNARKs to ensure scalability and decentralization. Unlike traditional blockchains that grow indefinitely, Mina remains fixed at 22 KB, making it perfect for privacy-focused applications.

### Why Use zk-SNARKs for Voting?
zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) allow someone to prove they voted without revealing:
- Who they voted for
- Their identity
- Their vote count in real-time

## 2. Understanding Zero-Knowledge Proofs in Voting

### Merkle Trees for Anonymous Vote Storage
A Merkle tree stores votes in a way that allows:
- **Verification without revealing votes**
- **Efficient and scalable counting**
- **Immutable vote records**

Example:  
A user votes YES (1).  
The vote is hashed and added to the Merkle tree.  
Only the Merkle root is stored on-chain, keeping the vote anonymous.

## 3. Setting Up the zkApp Project

### Installing Dependencies
1. Install `zkapp-cli` globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g zkapp-cli
   zkapp-cli@latest
   ```
2. Create a new project:
   ```bash
   zk project vote-app
   cd vote-app
   npm install
   npm install @o1labs/o1js
   ```

### Configuring the zkApp Environment
Inside the `src/Voting.ts`, define the zkApp logic.

## 4. Implementing the Voting Smart Contract

### Defining the Voting Logic
We define:
- **Vote validation**
- **Anonymous storage with Merkle trees**
- **Tallying the votes privately**

```ts
import { 
  Field, SmartContract, state, State, method, MerkleTree, Poseidon, 
  PrivateKey, PublicKey, Signature 
} from "@o1labs/o1js";

class Voting extends SmartContract {
  @state(Field) totalYesVotes = State<Field>();
  @state(Field) totalNoVotes = State<Field>();
  voteMerkleTree: MerkleTree;

  constructor() {
    super();
    this.voteMerkleTree = new MerkleTree(8);
  }

  @method vote(voteValue: Field, voterSignature: Signature, voterPublicKey: PublicKey) {
    voterSignature.verify(voterPublicKey, [voteValue]).assertTrue();
    const voteHash = Poseidon.hash([voteValue]);
    this.voteMerkleTree.setLeaf(BigInt(this.voteMerkleTree.leaves.length), voteHash);
    if (voteValue.equals(Field(1))) {
      this.totalYesVotes.set(this.totalYesVotes.get().add(Field(1)));
    } else if (voteValue.equals(Field(0))) {
      this.totalNoVotes.set(this.totalNoVotes.get().add(Field(1)));
    }
  }
}
```

### How It Works:
1. Voter signs the vote.
2. zk-SNARK verifies without revealing the vote.
3. Vote is hashed & added to the Merkle tree.
4. Total votes update, but no individual vote is exposed.

## 5. Deploying the zkApp on Mina Testnet

Run the following commands to deploy:
```bash
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

## 6. Building the Frontend for User Voting

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install @o1labs/o1js
```

### Step 2: Create `frontend/index.ts`
```ts
import { Voting } from "../src/Voting";
import { Field, PrivateKey, Signature, PublicKey } from "@o1labs/o1js";

// Generate voter keys
const voterPrivateKey = PrivateKey.random();
const voterPublicKey = voterPrivateKey.toPublicKey();
const votingApp = new Voting();

// Vote "YES"
const voteValue = Field(1);
const voteSignature = Signature.create(voterPrivateKey, [voteValue]);

// Submit the vote
await votingApp.vote(voteValue, voteSignature, voterPublicKey);
console.log("Vote submitted!");
```

### Step 3: Retrieve Results
```ts
console.log("Total Yes Votes:", await votingApp.totalYesVotes.get());
console.log("Total No Votes:", await votingApp.totalNoVotes.get());
```

## 7. Enhancing the zkApp

### Preventing Double Voting
A voter can only vote once by tracking used public keys:
```ts
@state(Field) votedUsers = State<Field>();

@method checkDoubleVoting(voterPublicKey: PublicKey) {
  let hashedKey = Poseidon.hash([voterPublicKey.toFields()[0]]);
  this.votedUsers.get().equals(hashedKey).assertFalse();
}
```

### Adding Proof of Eligibility
Before voting, users must prove they are on a whitelist:
```ts
@state(Field) voterMerkleRoot = State<Field>();

@method proveEligibility(voterMerkleProof: Field, voterPublicKey: PublicKey) {
  let hashedKey = Poseidon.hash([voterPublicKey.toFields()[0]]);
  voterMerkleProof.equals(this.voterMerkleRoot.get()).assertTrue();
}
```

## 8. Conclusion & Next Steps

We have successfully built a privacy-preserving voting system using Mina Protocol and O1js. Our system:
- âœ… Ensures anonymous voting
- âœ… Prevents vote tampering
- âœ… Uses zk-SNARKs for verifiability

### Next Steps:
- Enhance the UI for better user experience.
- Deploy on the Mina mainnet.
- Improve Merkle tree scalability.

This is the future of secure, decentralized democracy! ðŸŽ‰
